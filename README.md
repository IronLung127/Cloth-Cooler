### I HATE SUMMERS
Everything is way to hot. Last summer I found that A wet cloth is everything you need to bypass this. Just make every title of your floor wet and boom! Coolness. ***For 5 mins***
And do it again. I don't have time to do this.

## Arduino Saves the day
I have a ton of legos, so I will make a chasis with a cloth attached to it (Will as in ***WIP***)
